    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Yacht "Ibex," Weymouth.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Once again "my foot is on my native heath."&mdash;(I don't
    know where this quotation comes from, but presume the author of
    it had lost a leg, or he would have placed <i>his feet</i>
    there&mdash;or else he must have had one leg shorter than the
    other, and so <i>couldn't</i> put both down at once!)&mdash;and
    heartily glad I am to be there&mdash;we had a most alarming
    passage from Jersey, and I thought every moment would be my
    last&mdash;(<i>for a time</i>)&mdash;but I was cheered and
    stimulated to endurance by the noble example of my friend and
    fellow-passenger The MACDOUGAL&mdash;Chief of the
    Clan&mdash;who was obtrusively well up to lunch-time!&mdash;but
    I had my revenge then, for he was unable to face the dish of
    Haggis that I am given to understand every right-minded
    Scotchman thinks it his duty to eat at least once a day.</p>

    <p>However, "I pulled through all right," as Lord ARTHUR would
    say, and was so delighted with my sailor-like indifference to
    the "rolling-sea," that I adopted a rolling-walk on landing,
    which was most impressive, to judge from the staring of the
    inhabitants of Weymouth!&mdash;(I may confess to <i>you</i>
    that I couldn't help myself; everything was going up and down
    and sideways, for <i>hours</i> after I landed, and I really
    think the sea ought to be done away with, or flattened out by
    some means!&mdash;there's a fortune for the man who invents the
    machine which will do it!)&mdash;I should prefer it done away
    with myself, as then there would be no mackerel-fishing!</p>

    <p>I have no personal animosity against the humble but
    lovely-looking mackerel; but I was weak enough to accept an
    invitation to go fishing for them, and you may imagine my
    horror at being "roused out,"&mdash;(yachting expression,
    <i>very</i> significant)&mdash;at <i>three</i> in the morning
    to go and capture them!&mdash;or at least to
    <i>try</i>&mdash;for as a matter of fact, we didn't get a
    single one&mdash;and my temper was "roused out" before we'd
    finished, for no well-conducted woman cares to be balked in her
    efforts to "hook a big fish,"&mdash;and all I could catch were
    a few small "Pollock" and "Pout." By the way, who on earth
    christens the fish, I wonder?&mdash;and why on earth&mdash;or
    rather in sea&mdash;are there so many varieties which you must
    either remember or submit to nave your ignorance jeered at by
    the practised fisherman, who has probably acquired his
    information concerning them only the day before?</p>

    <p>The English "Bay of Naples" is a wonderful place, and its
    resemblance to its Italian prototype is admirably sustained
    through the liberality of the Local Board in encouraging the
    importation of Italian penny-ice men! I really think this
    wholesale importation of foreigners is being carried to excess,
    and has already created a feeling that England is no place for
    the English! And then the concerts you can hear for
    nothing!&mdash;that is, if you harden your heart when the man
    comes round with the tin pail!&mdash;everyone has a spade or a
    pail at the seaside&mdash;all the latest London successes, from
    TOSTI to "<i>Ta-ra-ra</i>," accompanied by a strong contingent
    of the Salvation Army Brass Band!&mdash;and there is a lot of
    "brass" about the Army still unaccounted for! What an
    enervating part of the world this is! One quite realises what
    "lotus-eating" means, even though there are no lotuses
    about!&mdash;(I wonder if that's the correct plural?&mdash;or
    is it "<i>Loti</i>"? which looks like French, only wants
    "PIERRE" as Christian name. Or if additional "<i>t</i>"
    introduced, it would be "Lotti," suggestive of COLLINS' Ode to
    <i>Boom</i>, &amp;c.; but I am wandering)&mdash;and it requires
    enormous energy to do anything more than loll about and bathe;
    even on the Island of Portland, where the air is rather more
    invigorating, I am told there are numbers of people who express
    a strong disinclination to perform any hard labour whatever, in
    spite of the fact of a short residence there having been
    recommended as calculated to improve their general "tone"! I
    only wish the aforesaid Salvation Army Band would go there on a
    lengthy visit, as its "tone" leaves much to be desired at
    present.</p>

    <p>I hear that the Brighton Meeting was a great success both in
    weather and racing; and the present "Horse of the Century,"
    <i>Buccaneer</i>, fully maintained his reputation, winning his
    race in what they call "gallant style," and beating <i>Lady
    Rosebery</i>&mdash;not, perhaps, a gallant thing to do, but
    Buccaneers have always been notoriously rough to the sex!</p>

    <p>I am afraid thousands of my readers must be getting
    impatient for more of my excellent prophecies, but I really
    cannot run the risk of ruining my health by reading the papers
    when in the country; and, as patience is an admirable virtue, I
    feel I am doing my duty in encouraging it as much as possible.
    So, for yet another cycle of time (poetic, and usefully
    vague),</p>

    <p class="author">I am,<br />
    Yours, in idleness, LADY GAY.</p>

    <h2>THE DIARY OF AN EXPLORER À LA RUSSE.</h2>

    <p><i>Introduction.</i>&mdash;Delighted to have the opportunity
    of exploring the Ironice Mountains. Hearing they abound with
    frozen mud which would be most useful if it could be removed to
    the plains below without melting. The watercress plant too
    might be grown on the summit, if it is practicable to take up
    orchid-forcing houses. Ought to get the Gold Medal of the
    Geographical Society if I open out this region that will be
    fraught with such blessings to commerce. So far as I can judge,
    it will only be necessary to take twenty batteries of
    Artillery, a dozen squadrons of Cavalry, and (say) sixteen
    battalions of Infantry. And I think we might as well take a
    Naturalist.</p>

    <p><i>A little Later.</i>&mdash;Made a good start. Appointed
    Professor POPOFF to be our Naturalist. He is a little out of
    practice, but passed the preliminary examination very
    satisfactorily. Only made one trifling mistake. Said that
    tea-roses belonged to the cactus family. Fancy they don't, but
    am not sure. The suggestion that cucumbers were dug out of the
    ground like potatoes, was only an error of judgment. Anyone
    might have made it. But although rusty in his science, he is
    well up in machine-gun drill. He will suit the expedition to a
    nicety. Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry in first-rate
    condition.</p>

    <p><i>Later still.</i>&mdash;Made our first important
    scientific discovery to-day. Find that you can't grow broad
    beans on the soil at the base of the Ironice Mountains. At
    least you may plant them, but they won't grow to any size
    within the space of half-a-dozen hours. Tried the experiment.
    To clear the necessary space of ground, had to remove the
    natives. Did this in gallant style with the assistance of all
    branches of the Service. The Professor rendered valuable
    support with his Gatling. Hadn't time to bury the kilted, but
    said some kind things, when bidding them adieu, to the
    wounded.</p>

    <p><i>Further on.</i>&mdash;Most anxious to discover whether
    canaries sing half-way up the Ironice Mountains. Had some
    little trouble in establishing a footing on the plateau. After
    eight hours' hard fighting got to the required spot. The
    natives seem to have no respect for scientific research. Had to
    remove them in the usual fashion. The Cavalry had to abandon
    their horses, but the dismounted men were most useful in
    burning villages. The Professor continued to carry up his
    Gatling, and used it with the customary result. When we got to
    the plateau, disappointed to find no canaries. So we could not
    ascertain whether they would sing at that altitude. However,
    when we have completed the proposed railway, it will be quite
    easy to bring up a few of those charming birds, and continue
    the interesting experiment.</p>

    <p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;After six weeks' hard fighting, have at
    last got to the summit. Cleared the place of the natives
    according to the recognised scientific formula. The Infantry
    had to use their bayonets freely. The Professor again well to
    the front with his Gatling. He is a wonderful man, and seems to
    have been accustomed to it all his life. It is almost a pity
    that he should be so devoted to science. He would have made a
    first-rate soldier.</p>

    <p><i>Nearly the Latest.</i>&mdash;Sorry that our expedition
    has not been entirely successful. I am very much afraid that it
    will be impossible to grow watercresses at this altitude, even
    with the genial aid of orchid-forcing houses. I do not see how
    we could get up the necessary materials to the summit, although
    assisted by proposed railway. Still, when the line is
    constructed, we might make the attempt. But from a commercial
    point of view, I do not believe that the experiment would repay
    the cost.</p>

    <p><i>Sequel.</i>&mdash;Delighted to find that our scientific
    expedition has one result. I have consulted the Professor, and
    we are both of the opinion, that from the summit of the Ironice
    Mountains it is possible to get a splendid bird's-eye view of
    India.</p>

    <p>A TRIO.&mdash;Congratulations to Sir WILLIAM CUSINS, who
    from his known admiration for WAGNER, is generally known as
    "Cusins German." He was a "King's Scholar," and KING, whoever
    he was, must have found him a remarkably apt pupil. He has
    composed a Comic Opera called <i>Giddy 'Un</i>. The next Knight
    is JOSEPH BARNBY, a name suggestive of pure rustic music. The
    last of the Knights, Sir WALTER PARRATT, has chosen as his
    device the ancient legend always associated with the head of
    the PARRATT family, <i>i.e.</i>, "Scratch a Poll." This dates
    from very ancient times, and was an inscription found in a

    this morning, I have lost my purse, my handkerchief, the keys

    season-ticket, and a pocket-book containing priceless materials
    for the plot of a three-volumed novel. This comes of riding on
    the outside of an omnibus with garden-seats.&mdash;Conductor,
    the gentlemanly person who sat just behind me, and who is now
    proceeding rather quickly up Chancery Lane, seems to have been
    unable to resist the temptation afforded by my hanging
    coat-tails, and has walked off with a few unpaid bills which
    were in the pockets, under a mistaken impression that they were
    bank-notes. Would you mind explaining to him his
    mistake?&mdash;Would it be possible for the excellent Directors
    of the London General Omnibus Company and the London Road Car
    Company, so to board up the open backs of their otherwise
    delightful garden-seats as to prevent a ride on the top of an
    omnibus from being a constant series of (generally unwarranted)
    suspicions of the people seated in one's rear?</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Thursday, August 4.</i>&mdash;New
    Parliament met to-day in great force. Ambition stirs noble
    minds in different ways. Some embark on Parliamentary life with
    determination to outshine BRIGHT or GLADSTONE in field of
    oratory. Others will not be pacified till they emulate PITT.
    Others again aim at the lofty pedestal on which stands through
    the ages the man who is first in his place, on first day, of
    first Session, of new Parliament. Exciting race to-day. At
    night, both BIGWOOD and SPENCER (not BOBBY, who has affairs of
    graver State to look to just now) sailed in together. At a
    quarter to ten SAVORY turned up, sermon in hand, and found he
    was forestalled.</p>

    <p>"What, MOORE of them!" cried SAVORY. "The bane of my
    life."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said LOGAN, arriving a few minutes later; "wherever
    there's one SAVORY you're sure to find MOORE, and in this case
    they precede you."</p>

    <p>Six minutes later DIXON-HARTLAND arrived, mopping his
    forehead. When he found others on spot, pretended he'd only
    looked in accidentally. "Passing by, you know; thought I'd see
    how old place looked." But it wouldn't do. Other men,
    especially BIGWOOD, saw through it all. Then DIXON HARTLAND
    grew anecdotal. Told fabulous story about imaginary Scotch
    Member, who, at opening of Parliament of 1880, brought down his
    plaid, a stoup of whiskey, and a thimbleful of oatmeal. Camped
    out all night in Palace Yard, and staggered into House as soon
    as doors were opened.</p>

    <p>"That beats you, BIGWOOD," the Evesham Banker said, with a
    tartness of voice that betrayed his chagrin.</p>

    <p>Rest of the 665 Members content to look in later. By one
    o'clock House full, Lobby overflowing. Difficult to move
    through the close ranks, and yet there were many gaps. Ranks of
    old House more than decimated. "There they go," said my young
    but fiery friend FURNISS, whom I came upon in corner of Lobby,
    rapidly sketching with blurred eyesight.</p>

    <p>"Who go?" I asked, remembering with a start I had left my
    gold-nobbed stick in the corner by the Post Office.</p>

    <p>"The Members we shall miss," he sobbed, lingering fondly
    over the truculent curl of HERMON-HODGE's moustache.</p>

    <p>But if gone are some familiar faces, others come back. Glad
    to see MACFARLANE in his old place below Gangway, and to find
    him later in old seat in smoking-room. MACFARLANE didn't often
    speak in debate, but usually had something to say. Was a
    Home-Ruler long before the majority found salvation. Remember
    across the years how he put whole case in crisp sentence when
    he adjured the deaf Government of the day "not to attempt to
    enforce Greenwich-time at Dublin." If BRIGHT had said that, or
    DIZZY, or Mr. G., the happy phrase would have echoed down the
    corridors of time. But it was only an Irish Member; MACFARLANE,
    then Member for Carlow. So it passed
    unnoticed&mdash;unremembered rather than forgotten.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Speaker elected. ARTHUR
    WELLESLEY PEEL for the fourth time. House evidently under
    impression it can't have too much of good thing.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to watch growth of full-blown
    SPEAKER in New Parliament. First stage&mdash;enters in ordinary
    morning dress, and seats himself with other Members, diligently
    trying to look as if he expected nothing to happen. Sore
    temptation for Members sitting near him. Would like to slap him
    on the back, and ask how he got on through his Election. Short
    of that, feel they must ask if he wants a pair? Is he dining
    here? Is he going to have a smoke, or a stroll on the Terrace?
    Next day, having meanwhile been proposed, seconded, and
    inducted to Chair, SPEAKER-ELECT turns up in Court-dress, with
    Bob-wig. This is Development-stage. Having reached it, proceeds
    to the House of Lords, where he is patronisingly received by
    LORD CHANCELLOR. ("HALSBURY," SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE says,
    "peculiarly well up in patronage.") This done, returns to
    Commons; disappears behind Chair; SERGEANT-AT-ARMS counts
    twenty-three; presto! door re-opens; SPEAKER re-appears in
    butterfly-trim, with full-bottomed wig, silk gown, and shoon on
    which shimmer the sheen of silver buckles.</p>

    <p>No trifling with SPEAKER when this final stage reached.
    KEIR-HARDIE took early opportunity of trying a fall with
    him&mdash;and got it. HARDIE fresh from the coal-pit,
    represents West Ham; evidently determined to pose as Stage
    Workman. "DON'T KEIR-HARDIE is my name," he said, swaggering
    into House just now. "Don't keer a &mdash;&mdash; for SPEAKER,
    or any black-coated bloke. I'm the true British Workman, and
    will soon make all you blooming gentry sit up."</p>

    <p>"Are you going to take the Oath?" said COBB. COBB always
    asking questions.</p>

    <p>"Oath!" cried DON'T KEIR-HARDIE, "I'll take 'em in a
    moog."</p>

    <p>Put on his cap, and swaggered towards the table. "Order!
    order!" cried SPEAKER, in tones of thunder. "DON'T KEIR-HARDIE
    is my name," said Hon. Member for West Ham; "and blow me
    if&mdash;". Turned, and saw flashing eye of SPEAKER bent upon
    him. Slowly his hand went up to his head; the cap came off, was
    crumpled up, and put in his pocket.</p>

    <p>"Will you take the oath, or make affirmation?" asked MILMAN,
    stuck between two tables, but always ready to oblige.</p>

    <p>"Don't keer which," said DON'T KEIR-HARDIE; but, possibly
    from force of habit, took the oath.</p>

    <p>"If OLD MORALITY was still with us, my friend," said BURT,
    gravely, "he would be able to cite for your edification a
    copy-head showing how Don't Care came to a bad end."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Swearing going on in both
    Houses. Our Army in Flanders quite respectable by
    comparison.</p>

    <h2>ROBERT ON THINGS IN GINERAL.</h2>

    <p>I was only jest a thinkin the other day, what werry
    distinguisht honner Her Most Grashus Madgesty the QUEEN would
    bestow on the Rite Honerabel the LORD MARE, when the rite time
    cum. But I was ardly prepaird for the acshal fack!</p>

    <p>I reelly coudn't have bleeved it if I hadn't a had it red
    out to me from a most respecfool Mornin Paper; so in course it
    must be trew. Yes, the Rite Honorabel the LORD MARE is not only
    to be a Nite, like other Lord Mares, but the QUEEN has acshally
    made him a Nite Commander of the most xtinguisht Order of Saint
    Mikel, and, not sattisfide with ewen that, Her MADGESTY has
    also made him a Nite Commander of the other most xtinguisht
    Order of Saint George!</p>

    <p>It is fortnit that Sir DAVID's year of offis will soon end,
    or he mite have fownd it diffikult to carry out his ushal LORD
    MARE's numerus dootys, while Commanding two sitch xtinguisht
    Orders as them as is named above.</p>

    <p>My Amerricane Friend has turnd up agane at our bewtifool
    Grand Otel. He says as they has had orful whether wear he has
    cum from, but all the hole week he has had in grand old Lundon
    has bin most luvly Sun-Shine, as it amost allers is in Spring,
    he says he's told. As he luckly didn't appen for to arsk for no
    arnser, of course I didn't give him not none; but I coudn't
    help a thinkin as how as if he had bin here in our late hurly
    Spring, he might ha bin inclined jest a leetel to halter his
    good opinyon.</p>

    <p>We had qwite a plezzent chat while I atended upon him at
    Lunch. He wants to kno more about our LORD MARE. Fust of all,
    how much munney he gits; and, when I told him jest ten thowsand
    pounds for his year of offics, he xclaimd, "Why, that's the
    werry same sum as we gives our President, who, you know, is
    reelly our King!" So I said, "Does he find it enuff for him,
    Sir?" "Oh yes," he says, "quite." "Well," says I, "it don't
    seem a werry big salery for the King of such a big plaice as
    Amerrikey, when I appens to know that the LORD MARE of our
    little Lundon, which is ony about one mile big, has to spend
    more than another ten thousand pounds out of his own pocket
    afore he's finished his year!" "Well," he says, "you do
    estonish me; but everythink's estonishing in your grand old
    Citty! How do they send him his money?" I told him as the
    Chamberlane, who was allers cram full of munney, took it him
    every quarter-day. "Ah," says he, "we send our President, on
    the 26th of evry month, exakly eight hundred and thirty-three
    pounds, six-and-eight pence." "Ah," I said, "I am rayther
    serprized as he shoud condersend to take the odd six-and-eight.
    I'm quite shure our LORD MARE woudn't do so. I bleeve as he
    never has not nothink less than Bank-notes and suvreigns, but
    allers plenty of 'em." "How many dinners does he give during
    the year?" says he. "Ah, Sir," says I, "that's rayther a
    staggering qweshun to arnser. Me and BROWN has often tried our
    hands at it, but ginerally breaks down about Witsuntide; but I
    shoud say sumwares about three thowsand, and about twice as
    many lunchons." "Good grayshus!" says the Amerricane, "what a
    number!" "Yes," says I, "and so much is they thort on, that
    p'raps the werry greatest trubbel that has worrited the manly
    bussoms of Lord SORLSBUBY and all his brother Ministers is the
    mellancolly fack, that they has bin compelld to decline the
    LORD MARE's customery Ministerial Bankwet this year, coz they
    coudn't tell for serten whether they would be the Ministers to
    go to it! And the LORD MARE to drown his sorrer has gone and
    berried hisself in the 'art of Scotland!" "What a sad story to
    be shure!" said my Amerricane, with a sigh! "Yes, Sir," I
    replied, "these are sum of the many trubbels as our werry
    greatest men has to endewr, and happy is he who does not quiver
    when he has his arrow full of 'em!" And so we parted.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
